# Internationalization (i18n)

- **Synchronous Updates**: When adding, modifying, or removing a translation key in `messages/*.json`, you MUST update ALL supported language files (`en.json`, `es.json`, `zh.json`) simultaneously.
- **Consistency**: Ensure keys are identical across all files.
- **Placeholders**: If a professional translation is not available, use the English text or a temporary machine translation, but do not leave keys missing.
